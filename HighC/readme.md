# High Sierra has had numerous issues. I'll try and capture some of them here

Numerous blog posts detailing how there was no root password

## Undocumented changes to Kext

## HFS+ gets converted to APFS by FileVault
"also, neat (but dumb) 10.13 bug i just encountered: if you encrypt an existing HFS+ external drive, the OS converts it to APFS, then encrypts. even for time machine drives, which should remain HFS+."

This already bit one vendor that put out a new installer (Prezi Desktop).
